Little utilities that I've written in AppleScript and JavaScript for
Automation (JXA) [1].

While most OSA [2] script runners can directly handle `.applescript`
files, I expect that few (if any) support `.js` files. Any of these
scripts can be run directly using `osascript(1)` or compiled using
`osacompile(1)`. (The `compile` script is a convenience wrapper for the
latter.)
