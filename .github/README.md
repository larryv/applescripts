Little utilities that I've written in AppleScript and
[JavaScript for Automation][JXA] (JXA).

While most [OSA][OSA] script runners can directly handle `.applescript`
files, I expect that few (if any) support `.js` files.  Any of these
scripts can be run directly using `osascript(1)` or compiled using
`osacompile(1)`.  (The [`compile`][compile] script is a convenience
wrapper for the latter.)

[COMPILE]: ../compile
